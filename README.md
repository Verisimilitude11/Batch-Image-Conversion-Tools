## What is an image to grayscale converter?
This software turns color photos into grayscale ones. Only gray color information is left in the output image after it removes all color channel information. You only see a black and white image as a result. There are several methods for removing color from an image, so you can select the conversion algorithm or enter your own constant weights to specify how much grayscale to extract from each color channel.
